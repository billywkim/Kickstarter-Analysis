# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this analysis is to determine the best possible outcome (Specifically for theaters) by sorting the data by Launch Date and Goals. The data was filtered to provide an easily legible chart and graph for anyone to read.

## Analysis and Challenges

### On the Analysis of Outcomes by Launch Date, a Pivot Table was created to focus on data that would break down the raw data by dates. Furthermore, additional filters of Parent Categories and Years were added. The image below shows the data based on outcomes of theaters in all years. A line chart was added to represent this information.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
